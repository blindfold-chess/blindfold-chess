        <h1>Blindfold Chess App: User Guide</h1>
        <h2>💡 Core Idea: Play Silently with Eyes Closed</h2>
        <p>The core idea of this app is that you play with your eyes closed and without using your voice. Simply put on earplugs, close your eyes, control the pieces by just touching the screen-quadrants with your thumbs. You can enjoy a completely immersive, audio-guided chess experience, without disturbing others.</p>

        <h2>🎮 How to Play</h2>

        <h3>Starting a New Game</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Open the App:</strong> The app starts on the <strong>Menu</strong> screen.</li>
            <li><strong>Select Boards:</strong> Choose the number of simultaneous games you wish to play (from 1 to 8).</li>
            <li><strong>Choose Your Color:</strong> In case of playing one board: select "White" or "Black" from the "Choose color" dropdown. <strong>Note:</strong> If you choose to play multiple boards, this setting is not available, and your color will alternate (White/Black) for each successive board.</li>
            <li><strong>Select AI Level (Depth):</strong> Choose a numerical value (1-15) from the "Level" dropdown. This directly sets how many moves deep the Stockfish AI will calculate, with higher numbers indicating a stronger opponent.</li>
            <li><strong>Select Variant:</strong> Choose "Standard" for regular chess or "Chess 960" for a random starting position. The starting position will be displayed visually on the menu screen.</li>
            <li><strong>Always Promote to Queen:</strong> By default, this option is enabled, meaning your pawns will automatically promote to a Queen. <strong>Uncheck this option</strong> if you want to manually choose your promotion piece (Rook, Bishop, or Knight) during the game.</li>
            <li><strong>Mention Color:</strong> By enabling this option, you will hear "black pawn" instead of just "pawn", etc. at each move.</li>            
            <li><strong>Start Game:</strong> Tap the "Start Game" button.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Using the Game Menu</h3>
        <p>During a game, tapping the white square in the center will open a menu with the following options:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>"Undo Last Move":</strong> Tap this to undo the last full move (your move and the AI's response). In multi-board mode, it will undo the current board's last (AI) move and then switch to the previous board to undo your last move.</li>
            <li><strong>"Cancel Selection":</strong> If you've started selecting a square but want to reset, tap this button. It will clear your current partial selection. <i>A shortcut for this is to swipe from right to left over at least 25% of the screen width (without opening the game menu).</i></li>
            <li><strong>"View PGN":</strong> When in doubt about the move history, you can see the history of all the boards you're playing in a PGN-like format and then "Resume Game".</i></li>
            <li><strong>"Main Menu":</strong> Returns you to the main menu. Here you can review the 960 starting position and then click "Resume Game".</li>
            <li><strong>"Resume Game":</strong> Returns you to your current game.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Making a Move (Square Selection)</h3>
        <p>The game screen consists of four large, touchable quadrants:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>TL</strong> (Top Left)</li>
            <li><strong>TR</strong> (Top Right)</li>
            <li><strong>BL</strong> (Bottom Left)</li>
            <li><strong>BR</strong> (Bottom Right)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When you use the app in full-screen mode, you can use your thumbs to tap these quadrants. To select any square of the 8x8 chessboard, you will make <strong>three consecutive taps</strong> on these quadrants. Each tap narrows down the selection to a smaller quadrant, eventually pinpointing a single square. Visual help is provided during play to get acquainted with this system.</p>

        <p><strong>Example 1: tapping BR BL TL selects E2 (for White)</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Tap 1 (BR):</strong> Selects the bottom-right 4x4 quadrant (<strong>e1-h4</strong>).</li>
            <li><strong>Tap 2 (BL):</strong> Selects the bottom-left 2x2 quadrant (<strong>e1-f2</strong>) within the previous 4x4 (e1-h4).</li>
            <li><strong>Tap 3 (TL):</strong> Selects the top-left 1x1 square (<strong>e2</strong>) within the previous 2x2 (e1-f2).</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>(Note: The actual quadrant sequence for a specific square depends on your chosen color (White or Black) as the board is oriented from your perspective.)</em></p>

        <p><strong>Other examples:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>TR TR TR selects h8 (or a1 if you have the black pieces).</li>
            <li>TL BR BR selects d5 (or e4 if you have the black pieces).</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Steps to Make a Move:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Select the "From" Square:</strong> Perform <strong>three taps</strong> to select the square of the piece you want to move.
                <ul>
                    <li>The app will announce your chosen square (e.g., "White pawn from e2").</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Select the "To" Square:</strong> Perform <strong>another three taps</strong> to select the destination square for your piece.
                <ul>
                    <li>The app will announce the destination square (e.g., "to e4").</li>
                    <li>If the move is illegal, you will hear "That's an illegal move". The square selection is undone so that you can try again.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Promotion</h3>
        <p>If your pawn reaches the last rank and you have <strong>unchecked</strong> the "Always promote to queen" option in the menu:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>After selecting the "to" square for your pawn's promotion, the app will announce: "Choose a promotion piece."</li>
            <li>The four touchable quadrants will now visually display the chess piece icons in your color, representing the promotion options:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Top Left: Queen</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Top Right: Rook</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Bottom Left: Bishop</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Bottom Right: Knight</strong></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Tap the quadrant corresponding to the piece you wish to promote to.
                <ul>
                    <li>The app will confirm your choice by finishing the move sentence with – for example – "promoted to Queen". The full sentence that you've heard, might then be: "White pawn from f7 takes g8 – choose a promotion piece – promoted to Queen".</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>🧠 Tips for Blindfold Play</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Practice Coordinates:</strong> Familiarize yourself with algebraic notation (e.g., a1, h8) thoroughly.</li>
            <li><strong>Start Simple:</strong> Begin with standard chess, 1 board, and easier AI levels (lower depth), then gradually increase complexity.</li>
            <li><strong>Verify that you remember:</strong> During each of your turns, verify that you remember all piece positions.</li>
            <li><strong>Peek in the PGN viewer:</strong> When in doubt about past moves, use the "View PGN" button.</li>
            <li><strong>Don't Be afraid to Undo:</strong> Use the "Undo Last Move" button to correct mistakes, especially when learning.</li>
            <li><strong>Use "Mention color":</strong> By enabling the "Mention color" setting (via the main menu), you will hear "black pawn" instead of just "pawn", etc. at each move. This may reinforce your mental representation of the pieces and be easier for learning.</li>            
            <li><strong>Take care of your health:</strong> Some professional players advice against playing too many boards blindfolded. Take care of your brain ❤️</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Enjoy your blindfold chess journey!</p>
